Section 8 of the WotC OGL states that when distributing Open Game Content, I need to declare which portions of work are OGC.
This .NET class library is Open Game Content and contains Open Game Content from other OGC Conrtibutors.
All OGC created by other contributors is properly listed in Section 15 of the "OGL Licence.txt" file included with this project.

Note to contributors of this .NET Solution: Keep all OGC in this project. Do not use OGC in other projects. Reference this library when you need to use OGC.
